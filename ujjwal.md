# Developer Code Review: Ujjwal

## Code Assessment

### Plus Points

- Complete implementation of both tasks
- Good handling of edge cases
- Detailed implementation of monthYearStats logic
- Proper sorting by userID

### Minus Points

- Complex logic in mergeUserData function could be simplified
- Date comparison logic has potential issues
- Some console.log statements left in code
- Some code formatting issues

### Improvement Suggestions

- Simplify the mergeUserData implementation using maps/dictionaries
- Improve date comparison logic for youngest user detection
- Remove console.log statements
- Clean up code formatting

### Time Complexity Analysis

- Merging Arrays: O(n + m) - Overall efficient but implementation is complex
- Analytics Generation: O(k) where k is number of merged records

## Scoring

| Category                | Score | Comments                                                           |
