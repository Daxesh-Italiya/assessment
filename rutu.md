# Developer Code Review: Rutu

## Code Assessment

### Plus Points

- Attempted to implement a structured approach with functions
- Good handling of null values with nullish coalescing

### Minus Points

- Serious logic error in merging (just concatenates arrays)
- Missing implementation of second task (analytics)
- Inefficient nested map approach
- No actual return from the function, just console.log
- Same code in both task and task.txt files

### Improvement Suggestions

- Completely revise the merging logic to properly merge by userID
- Implement the missing analytics functionality
- Simplify the implementation to avoid nested maps
- Add proper return statements instead of console.log

### Time Complexity Analysis

- Merging Arrays: Current implementation has nested loops - O(n\*m)
- Analytics Generation: Missing

| Code Completion         | 3/10  | Basic structure present but major functionality missing or incorrect |
| Structure & Readability | 4/10  | Function structure exists but implementation has issues              |
| Performance             | 3/10  | Inefficient implementation with nested loops                         |
| Logical Reasoning       | 3/10  | Misunderstood core requirements of merging by userID                 |
| Number of Commits       | 2     | Basic implementation with update                                     |
| Branch Lifecycle        | N/A   | Limited commit information available                                 |

## Final Verdict

**Overall Score: 3.3/10** - Implementation is incomplete and has significant issues.
