# Developer Code Review: Parthil

## Code Assessment

### Plus Points

- Complete implementation of both tasks
- Good error handling for null/undefined values
- Efficient map-based approach for merging
- Clean implementation of analytics logic
- Proper date handling for youngest user detection

### Minus Points

- Some unnecessary console.log statements
- Test arrays defined but not used in the actual execution
- Some commented-out code makes readability slightly harder

### Improvement Suggestions

- Remove console.log statements and commented code
- Clean up unused test arrays
- Improve code organization with better function naming

### Time Complexity Analysis

- Merging Arrays: O(n + m) - Efficient implementation
- Analytics Generation: O(k) where k is number of merged records
