# Developer Code Review: Raj

## Code Assessment

### Plus Points

- Efficient approach using objects as maps for merging
- Correct implementation of the merging logic
- Good handling of all the required merging rules

### Minus Points

- Partial implementation of Task 2 - missing monthYearStats
- Empty code spaces and unnecessary whitespace
- Missing proper function encapsulation
- No sorting implementation (though Map.keys() may preserve insertion order)

### Improvement Suggestions

- Complete the monthYearStats functionality
- Properly encapsulate the code in functions
- Clean up whitespace
- Add explicit sorting to ensure userID order

### Time Complexity Analysis

- Merging Arrays: O(n + m) - Efficient implementation
- Analytics Generation: Incomplete

## Scoring

| ----------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code Completion         | 6/10  | Task 1 complete, Task 2 partially implemented                              |
| Structure & Readability | 5/10  | Lacks proper function structure and has formatting issues                  |
| Performance             | 7/10  | Efficient approach for the implemented parts                               |
| Logical Reasoning       | 6/10  | Good understanding of merging logic but incomplete reasoning for analytics |
| Number of Commits       | 2     | Implementation with update                                                 |
| Branch Lifecycle        | N/A   | Limited commit information available                                       |

## Final Verdict

**Overall Score: 6/10** - Good implementation of Task 1 but incomplete Task 2.
