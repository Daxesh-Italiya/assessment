# Developer Code Review: Bhavya

## Code Assessment

### Plus Points

- Used a map approach for efficient merging of arrays based on userID
- Correctly implemented the merge functionality as per requirements
- Properly handled null values for missing fields
- Implementation of monthYearStats logic for analytics is present

### Minus Points

- Logic to find youngest user has implementation bugs (date comparison has issues)
- Missing the sorting of merged array by userID
- Console.log statements left in code for debugging
- Commented-out code fragments make the code less readable

### Improvement Suggestions

- Fix the date comparison logic for finding youngest user
- Implement proper sorting of merged array by userID
- Remove console.log statements and commented-out code
- Add proper function encapsulation instead of loose script

### Time Complexity Analysis

- Merging Arrays: O(n + m) - Efficient map-based approach
- Analytics Generation: O(k) where k is number of merged records

## Scoring

| Category                | Score   | Comments                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Code Completion         | 7/10    | Main functionality is implemented but with issues in analytics computation     |
| Structure & Readability | 5/10    | Lacks proper function organization, contains debugging code and comments       |
| Performance             | 7/10    | Map-based approach is efficient, but there are potential optimizations         |
| Logical Reasoning       | 6/10    | Good understanding of core merging concept but date comparison logic has flaws |
| Number of Commits       | 2       | Basic implementation with update                                               |
| Branch Lifecycle        | ~1h 33m | Time between branch creation and second commit                                 |

## Final Verdict

**Overall Score: 6.3/10** - Implementation works for basic cases but needs refinement in analytics and code structure.
