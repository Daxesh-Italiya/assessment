# Developer Code Review: Nikunj

## Code Assessment

### Plus Points

- Used a proper class structure (UserData) for the data model
- Attempted to separate concerns into different functions

### Minus Points

- Serious logic error in merging arrays - will fail for arrays of different lengths
- Incorrect indexing in the merging function (a[i], b[i] direct comparison)
- Incomplete implementation of monthYearStats requirement
- Dart code not properly structured for execution
- Missing sorting of merged array by userID

### Improvement Suggestions

- Completely revise the merging logic to handle arrays of different lengths
- Use maps or dictionaries instead of indexed loops for merging
- Implement missing monthYearStats functionality
- Add proper sorting of the merged array

### Time Complexity Analysis

- Merging Arrays: O(min(n,m)) - Current implementation is limited by smallest array
- Analytics Generation: Incomplete - missing key functionality

## Scoring

| Category                | Score | Comments                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code Completion         | 4/10  | Basic structure present but critical functionality is missing or incorrect    |
| Structure & Readability | 5/10  | Class structure is good but function implementation needs improvement         |
| Performance             | 3/10  | Current implementation has serious limitations                                |
| Logical Reasoning       | 4/10  | Basic understanding of the problem but fundamental errors in algorithm design |
| Number of Commits       | 2     | Basic implementation with update                                              |
| Branch Lifecycle        | N/A   | Limited commit information available                                          |

## Final Verdict

**Overall Score: 4/10** - Implementation has significant flaws that would prevent it from working correctly in most scenarios.
