# Developer Code Review: Mohit

## Code Assessment

### Plus Points

- Attempted to create a structured approach with separate functions
- Handles the userID property correctly

### Minus Points

- Serious logical issues in the merging algorithm
- Complex and error-prone checkIfAvailable function
- Missing Task 2 implementation
- Inefficient looping structure
- Missing sorting requirement

### Improvement Suggestions

- Completely revise the merging algorithm using maps or dictionaries
- Implement the missing analytics functionality
- Simplify the code logic
- Add proper error handling

### Time Complexity Analysis

- Merging Arrays: Current implementation has nested loops - O(n\*m)
- Analytics Generation: Missing
