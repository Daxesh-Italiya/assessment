# Developer Code Review: Bansari

## Code Assessment

### Plus Points

- Clean separation of input data and merging function
- Good handling of null values with nullish coalescing operators

### Minus Points

- Critical logic error in merging function - concatenates arrays without merging by userID
- No implementation of Task 2 (Analytics generation)
- Missing sorting by userID requirement
- No handling of userID-based merging as specified in requirements

### Improvement Suggestions

- Completely revise the merging logic to combine records by userID
- Implement the analytics generation functionality (Task 2)
- Add proper sorting of the merged array
- Use a map-based approach for more efficient merging

### Time Complexity Analysis

- Merging Arrays: O(n + m) but incorrect implementation as it doesn't merge by userID
- Analytics Generation: Missing

## Scoring

| Category                | Score | Comments                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code Completion         | 3/10  | Only partially implements Task 1, missing Task 2 completely    |
| Structure & Readability | 5/10  | Clean function structure but incomplete                        |
| Performance             | 3/10  | Current implementation doesn't meet requirements               |
| Logical Reasoning       | 3/10  | Misunderstood core requirement of merging data based on userID |
| Number of Commits       | 2     | Basic implementation with update                               |
| Branch Lifecycle        | N/A   | Limited commit information available                           |

## Final Verdict

**Overall Score: 3.7/10** - Implementation is incomplete and the existing merging function doesn't meet requirements.
