# Developer Code Review: Jatin-Thummar

## Code Assessment

### Plus Points

- Clean implementation of the mergeUserData function using Map
- Proper handling of null values for missing fields
- Good separation of concerns into task1 and task2 functions
- Efficiently sorts the merged array by userID

### Minus Points

- Logic for determining youngest user in monthYearStats has issues
- The algorithm for grouping by month-year might not be accurate
- Some unnecessary variables declared but not used (newRecord)
- Task.txt is completely empty, code is in assessment.js

### Improvement Suggestions

- Fix the groupBy extraction logic to properly format "MM-YYYY"
- Improve youngest user detection with more accurate date comparison
- Remove unused variables to improve code cleanliness
- Add error handling for edge cases like malformed date strings

### Time Complexity Analysis

- Merging Arrays: O(n + m) - Efficient implementation with Map
- Analytics Generation: O(k) where k is number of merged records

## Scoring

| Category                | Score   | Comments                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code Completion         | 8/10    | Both required functions implemented, minor issues in analytics logic              |
| Structure & Readability | 7/10    | Good function separation, but could use better variable naming                    |
| Performance             | 8/10    | Efficient implementation with Map data structure                                  |
| Logical Reasoning       | 7/10    | Good understanding of merging and analytics but issues with date extraction logic |
| Number of Commits       | 2       | Basic implementation with updates                                                 |
| Branch Lifecycle        | ~1h 55m | Time between branch creation and commit                                           |

## Final Verdict

**Overall Score: 7.7/10** - Solid implementation with minor issues in analytics logic and organization.
