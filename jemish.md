# Developer Code Review: Jemish

## Code Assessment

### Plus Points

- Complete implementation of both tasks
- Clean code structure with well-named functions
- Efficient approach using Sets and maps for merging
- Proper handling of null values
- Good separation of analytics logic

### Minus Points

- Logic for determining youngest user might have issues (comparing day part only)
- Error handling could be improved for edge cases
- Minor code complexity in the analyze function

### Improvement Suggestions

- Improve date comparison logic for youngest user determination
- Add error handling for malformed date strings
- Consider simplifying some of the analytics logic

### Time Complexity Analysis

- Merging Arrays: O(n + m) - Efficient implementation
- Analytics Generation: O(k) where k is number of merged records
