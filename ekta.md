# Developer Code Review: Ekta

## Code Assessment

### Plus Points

- Used a structured class approach with UserData model
- Attempted to implement array merging logic

### Minus Points

- Serious logic errors in merging function (using values.first and values.last is fragile)
- Incomplete implementation - missing Task 2 entirely
- Large blocks of commented-out code
- Missing sorting requirement
- Debug print statements scattered throughout the code

### Improvement Suggestions

- Completely rework the merging logic to use maps or dictionaries
- Remove all commented-out code
- Implement the missing analytics functionality
- Clean up debug print statements
- Add proper sorting of the output array

### Time Complexity Analysis

- Merging Arrays: Current implementation is problematic, complexity not relevant
- Analytics Generation: Missing

## Scoring

| Category                | Score | Comments                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Code Completion         | 3/10  | Basic structure present but major functionality missing or incorrect                 |
| Structure & Readability | 4/10  | Code organization needs improvement, too much commented code                         |
| Performance             | 3/10  | Implementation has fundamental issues                                                |
| Logical Reasoning       | 3/10  | Fragile approach to data access shows weak understanding of the merging requirements |
| Number of Commits       | 2     | Basic implementation with update                                                     |
| Branch Lifecycle        | N/A   | Limited commit information available                                                 |

## Final Verdict

**Overall Score: 3.3/10** - Implementation has significant issues and is incomplete.
